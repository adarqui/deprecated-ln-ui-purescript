misc goals:
[-] make sure every "error" in an Eval routine gets logged
[-] fix the damn logout/login navbar section.. it squishes too early.
[-] everything needs proper breadcrumbs

[x] breadcrumbs: Resources / 117
- should be Resources -> What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell
..
- how am I going to do that with my current Crumb setup? Might need to modify that to include a string... heh

[-] optional horizontal iframe when adding leurons, need this bad:

[-] ability to order leurons (via sift) by section etc.. need a section order so things can be written out of place.

- need an A favicon, and an A logo/background
- pretty "login/register" page
- set title on every url change
